Minke
=====

Minke is a package which aims to make it easier to produce gravitational waveforms in python.
It works with waveform models in the ``lalsimulation`` library maintained by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaborations, and makes them available in a format which is easy to work with while using modern python packages including ``astropy`` and ``gwpy``.

You can use Minke as part of your own code if you need to generate a waveform, or you can use it as part of a larger workflow thanks to its integration with ``asimov``.
It can produce waveform injections for sensitivity and recovery studies, and it can produce large data sets for training machine learning algorithms.

The Minke framework aims to be flexible, and easily extended to include new waveform morphologies, and signal distributions, so if you find something lacking feel free to make a pull request!
