Strain distributions
====================

When drawing a large number of source waveforms it can be useful to define a distribution of desired signal powers.

This is normally measured using the root-sum-squared strain (hrss).

A number of hrss distributions are built-in to Minke.

.. autofunction:: minke.distribution.burst_dist

Sky distributions
=================

Equally, you'll need to define a sky location for your waveforms. There are a number of ways to do this, and some are supported out-of-the-box by Minke.

.. autofunction:: minke.distribution.uniform_sky
